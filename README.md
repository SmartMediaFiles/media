## Overview

`media` is the central library of the **SmartMediaFiles ecosystem**. It does not contain any specific file analysis logic but acts as an aggregator and a central registry for all media types defined in the ecosystem.

## Features

- **Aggregation**: Imports file type and extension definitions from all specialized libraries (`media.image`, `media.raw`, etc.).
- **Central Registry**: Exposes a `Medias` variable, which is a complete map of all supported media types, associating each media type with its corresponding file types and extensions.
- **Common Types**: Defines the base types (`MediaType`, `FileType`, `FileExtension`) used consistently throughout the ecosystem.

## Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/smartmediafiles/media
```

## Usage

By importing this library, you get an overview of all files supported by SmartMediaFiles. You can use it to quickly determine the media type from a file extension before handing it over to a more specialized library for in-depth analysis.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/smartmediafiles/media"
)

func main() {
	// Print all supported media types
	fmt.Println(media.Medias.GetMediaTypes())
}
```
